# kafka-demo
A demo of an Apache Kafka multi-threaded producer/consumer with statistics visible via Graphite written in Scala.

The rundemo.sh script builds and publishes a local docker image with the producer/consumer, it will then execute docker-compose to build and run the required images for the application.
